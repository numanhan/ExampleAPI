#### About
- I first tested the daily weather information of certain cities via the Weather API using Postman manually.Then I automated it using Cucmber and Karate. Cucumber allows us to write and run our scripts as BDD using the Gherkin structure.

- Karate framework is a framework that allows us to test our APIs. Unlike tools like Postman, it allows us to use it in a language and save it as a folder. It also provides a great opportunity for us to run our sit tests in BDD format from Cucumber support.
